## Pokemon Dataset Challenge in Power BI hosted by Onyx DataDNA -- July 2022 

## Objective:

Here, it was asked to make a team of 6 Pokemon Players who can kill the most number of enemies. 
So, on the basis of dataset, 6 parameters was mentioned there on which I analyzed the data.

* hp
* sp_defense
* sp_attack
* speed
* defense
* attack

## Tools Used: Power BI, Figma, logomakr.com website and Google for downloading images of Pokemon.


## Steps taken in Power BI application:

* I used several DAX functions to calculate total number of generations, number and types of Pokemon, maximum base total and average of Pokemon.

I basically used the DISTINCTCOUNT, MAX AND AVG measure in Power BI to get those numbers as shown below after designed in the Power BI visual:

* Now, I thought of the background of the visualization which I took as combination of "blue", "red", "black" and "yellow".

I designed this background in Figma which looked somewhat like this after loading necessary shapes and icons on it.

* Now, I imported this background in Power BI, and put cards in Power BI as those DAX calculations did earlier.
 
 * Other than that, I used table and bar chart (displaying "Total Score" Vs Name") in Power BI.
 
 * Additionally, to make it more interactive and informative, I also added a "Decomposition tree" which overlays the bar chart in Power BI and I wired it using combination of "bookmark", "button" and "selection" panel of Power BI to show both on use of buttons.
 
 *Also, added a information panel button on top right of the page to display this feature which on clicking shows as shown below:
